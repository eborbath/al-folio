🌍✨ I’m thrilled to share to share that my Emmy Noether project, The New Climate Divide will be supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) - German Research Foundation ✨

It includes a 6-year postdoc position and two 4-year PhD positions, which I’ll be advertising soon. If ClimateDivide sounds intriguing, stay tuned! 👀

A new divide on climate change is emerging in electoral and civil society arenas, driven by an expanding right-wing front and the mainstreaming and fragmentation of the 'green field.' 🌍🌱 

In this context, the project asks three key sets of questions:
1️⃣ What coalitions of actors mobilize around the climate divide, and what types of repertoires do they adopt?
2️⃣ To what extent (depth), on what issues (breadth), and in what forms (electoral/non-electoral) do individuals participate on the climate divide? How is this participation influenced by the mobilizing actors’ repertoire of contention?
3️⃣ How are in-group and out-group identities shaped by mobilization and participation in the emerging climate divide, especially within the broader polycrisis context?

🔎The project bridges supply (parties & movements) and demand (participation) through a mixed-methods approach:
🔹 Computational social science
🔹 Survey-experimental methods
🔹 Qualitative analysis of in-group & out-group identity formation

It covers seven European countries:
🌍 Northwestern Europe: France, Germany, Sweden
🌞 Southern Europe: Italy, Spain
🧭 Central and Eastern Europe: Hungary, Romania
The study timeframe starts after the Copenhagen COP in 2010 and goes until the SE election in 2030. 📅
