        <p>Under pressure from increasing political instability and societal challenges, there is a renewed interest in
          the social basis of contemporary politics. The declining electoral support of mainstream political parties,
          like the Social -, and Christian Democrats, and the rise of new parties, such as the greens and the radical
          right, indicate a fundamental shift in the makeup of the post-war electoral coalitions. Class-based
          mobilization and conflict over welfare state policies are less influential in driving political behavior.
          Preferences over immigration, Europe, or climate change form new, group-based alliances that crosscut economic
          considerations and realign the social basis of politics. Others disagree and consider the contemporary
          dynamics a result of individualization that, although it leads to the crumbling and de-alignment of
          traditional political identities, does not give rise to a new, cohesive social force to re-structure political
          behavior. <br>
          The seminar focuses on cleavage politics: conflict stemming from deep and lasting divides between social
          groups. Among others, we examine cleavage formation, the social forces driving electoral support, historical
          legacies, the role of crisis and critical junctures, the dimensional alignment of political issues, the
          sociological basis of traditional and new cleavages, mobilization in party and protest politics, the role of
          agency in cleavage formation, and the use of group appeals by political entrepreneurs. Next to theories on
          cleavage politics and group appeals, the seminar emphasizes the methodological approaches applied in empirical
          studies, highlighting their potential to be used by students during their research for their MA thesis. We
          rely on literature primarily focused on Western Europe, but we also review studies on the political dynamics
          in Eastern Europe, North America, and South America.</p>

        <p>The seminar focuses on electoral and protest politics from a comparative European perspective. Although the
          study of elections and protests covers mobilization by the main collective actors of political parties and
          social movements in the two arenas of direct citizen involvement, research in this field has been
          characterized by disciplinary silos. Political science focuses on political parties and representation, while
          the political sociology tradition examines social movements, protest politics, and political participation.
          Few studies examine the manifold interaction between electoral and protest politics, leaving a research gap
          highlighted by recent developments in party competition in Western and Eastern Europe. Parties such as La
          République En Marche! in France, Fidesz in Hungary, and Die Linke in Germany invest considerable effort into
          developing an organic link with protest movements and civil society organizations. The seminar bridges
          political science and sociological approaches to provide a holistic assessment of electoral and protest
          mobilization. <br>
          The seminar is divided into four parts. The first three parts are distinguished based on the level of
          analysis, with separate sessions devoted to micro-, macro-, and meso-level approaches. In the first part, we
          ask, who participates and in what form? In the second part, we ask, what are the main cross-national
          differences in cleavage structures across Europe, and how can we explain them? In the third part, we ask,
          which are the actors that mobilize in elections or protests, how, and on what issues? In the fourth part of
          the seminar, we focus on the role of crises in altering long-term trends by comparing electoral and protest
          mobilization and participation in the aftermath of the Great Recession, the so-called Migration, and Corona
          crises. Next to reviewing theoretical approaches, the seminar introduces students to a set of diverse, mainly
          quantitative empirical strategies in the study of elections and protests. A background in statistical modeling
          provides an advantage, but it is not required for attending the seminar.</p>

          <p>Contemporary societies in Europe and beyond have seen the emergence of new cleavages, often driven by
            populist radical right challengers and cross-cutting traditional political divides. Importantly, these new
            cleavages have not only put traditional political parties under pressure but have also resulted in a
            profound politicization of civil society. The politicization of civil society refers to at least four
            dynamics: First, we have seen an increasing number of civil society organizations with socio-political
            objectives compared to leisure activities. Second, traditional civil society organizations (from unions,
            church-related associations, to sports clubs) have been forced to take sides in controversial political
            debates. Simultaneously, they have been challenged also within their own ranks by the rise of new political
            parties and movements. Third, new social movements from the right have successfully mobilized citizens on
            the streets by articulating nativist and anti-immigration positions. Finally, we have also seen increasing
            counter-mobilization against the rise of radical right populist forces. In the research placement, we will
            analyze these dynamics in civil society in Europe and beyond. The students will engage with theoretical
            accounts form civil society and social movement studies. They will conduct their empirical research, either
            based on existing data (such as individual or organizational survey data) or their own original data
            collections. Note that participants should have a good intermediary background in statistical modeling,
            using as software either Stata or R.</p>

          <p>Disasters and crises are always challenging for civil society. They lead to unforeseen emergencies and
            creates or reinforces inequalities in society. In such situations, not only the state is asked to help, but
            solidarity practiced by citizens is also needed. Such solidarity cannot be mandated. By contrast, it is
            based on the social capital of a society, i.e., the networks in which people are integrated and the trust
            they place in their fellow citizens and in public institutions. As in previous crises, civil society plays
            an important role in the current Corona crisis: It strengthens behavior based on solidarity, supports those
            in need, connects citizens, but also articulates criticism and draws attention to unheard grievances.
            However, disasters and crises can also weaken civil society. This ambivalence seems particularly evident in
            the Corona crisis. The current crisis has not only activated citizens, it has also come with considerable
            restrictions of the opportunities for political and civic engagement. In the research seminar, we will
            analyze this dilemma of civil society in Europe based on original survey data.</p>

          <p>The research placement focuses on different approaches to quantitative content analysis and their use in
            understanding the transformation of protest and electoral politics in Europe. The research placement makes
            both a methodological and a substantive contribution. From a methodological per-spective, the students will
            learn to read, understand and interpret the results of scientific research utilizing protest event, core
            sentence, and contentious episode analysis. The students will also learn to apply at least one of these
            approaches in their own research. From a substantive perspective, the course focuses on the transformation
            of political conflict in contemporary European societies. The students can choose their topics of interest
            related to these major transformations, but need to apply one of the three types of quantitative content
            analysis listed above. The participants need to have good knowledge of at least one statistical program.

          <p>The research practicum focuses on the dynamic and manifold relations between protest and electoral politics
            in Europe. Although social movements and political parties provide the two most important channels of
            democratic representation, research in political sociology still tends to neglect these rela-tions. Most
            importantly, this is due to a strong division of labor between those scholars who study social movement and
            protest, on the one side, and those who study political parties and elections, on the other. In the first
            part of the seminar, students will get familiar with some key approaches in both electoral and protest
            research before reading recently published studies that aim to bridge the two strands of the literature. In
            the second part, they will conduct their own empirical research on the top-ic. Given that we systematically
            distinguish between the levels of analysis (micro vs. meso/macro) and the type of political arena (electoral
            vs. protest) students should bridge at least one of the two boundaries to further advance our understanding
            of the dynamics of politics in contemporary Euro-pean societies. More specifically, the students can choose
            whether they will empirically approach the topic by means of a large protest event dataset based on the
            coding of international news wires or whether they approach it based on the analysis of individual-level
            surveys featuring questions about involvement in protest, elections, and/or party activities (in particular,
            the European Social Survey ESS). <br>
            In general, the research practicum serves to get students acquainted with conducting original research
            projects by coming up with their own research design and analyzing secondary material, either on their own
            or in small groups. Prior knowledge of the topic is not required but an advantage. Knowledge of quantitative
            data analysis is required given the type of data at hand. <br>

          <p>The politics of the "Refugee Crisis" drew attention to Euroskeptic, right-wing mobilization in Eastern
            Europe. Particularly in the Visegrád countries, scholars and observers document the rise of "illiberal
            democracy" and populism. However, it is unclear to what extent these developments follow a long-term trend
            and represent societal lines of conflict in Eastern European societies. The seminar critically examines the
            social and political structure of mobilization in Eastern Europe. The first two sessions present a
            theoretical overview on cleavage formation, the development of programmatic party competition, and the
            extent to which one observes recurring patterns of conflict amidst high electoral volatility. The third and
            fourth sessions consider recent developments and examine electoral and protest mobilization since the EU
            accession and the Great Recession. In these two sessions, we analyze the causes as well as the consequences
            of populist mobilization and counter-mobilization in the electoral and protest arena. </p>
