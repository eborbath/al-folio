The decline reaches its lowest point around 22 percent before the Presidential Elections in November 2019.</li> <li>initially, PNL can not benefit from the loss of PSD voters, but the party's popularity picks up as Iohannis' re-election campaign takes off before the 2019 Presidential Elections.</li> <li>gradual increase in the popularity of USR-PLUS, up until the 2019 Presidential Elections. <u><b>Note</b></u> that sometimes USR and PLUS were asked as a coalition, sometimes separately. The two parties contest in a coalition the 2020 parliamentary elections. To construct the trend line, I added together their popularity in surveys when asked separately.</li> </ul> <h3> Among Smaller Parties: </h3> <ul> <li>increase in the popularity of Pro Romania, up until it becomes a party of 6-7 percentage points. <u><b>Note</b></u> that since October 2020 the merger of Pro Romania-ALDE, ALDE was often not asked anymore. </li> <li>relatively stable support for PMP and UDMR.</li> </ul> <h2> Since the 2019 Presidential Elections</h2> <h3>Zooming in on larger parties</h3> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <img class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" src="/assets/img/polls/winners.jpeg" alt="" title="example image"> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> The popularity of the three largest parties since the 2019 Presidential Elections </div> <ul> <li>remarkable stability in the popularity of all three major formations: PSD, PNL, USR-PLUS.</li> <li>the Covid-19 crisis was not a rupture in the popularity of the governing PNL neither in a negative nor in a positive direction.
